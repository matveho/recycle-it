# recycle-it
HackED 2025 Project
## Inspiration
Imagine a world where recycling is effortless, waste is minimized, and every step brings society closer to a sustainable 
future. Recycle-it makes this vision a reality. Powered by advanced machine learning, it simplifies waste sorting, reduces 
contamination, and ensures better recycling accuracy. Whether at home, in a business, or within a community, Recycle-it 
empowers individuals to make a meaningful difference, driving a greener tomorrow with minimal effort.

## What It Does
Ultrasonic Sensors and Display Control: Ultrasonic sensors detect and classify objects accurately, preventing unnecessary 
energy consumption. The user interface optimizes energy use by adjusting brightness based on environmental conditions.
Raspberry Pi and Python for Frontend: The Raspberry Pi microprocessor runs pre-scripted Python code to open a designated 
URL in the browser. The system remains powered on for faster access, bypassing boot time to enhance user experience.
Machine Learning for Object Classification: The system classifies various recyclable materials and identifies lead 
contamination, notifying users on proper disposal methods to ensure sustainability.
User-Friendly Frontend: The system emphasizes minimal user input, making recycling accessible to everyone and enabling 
positive environmental change with a simple and intuitive interface.

## How It Was Built
**Hardware Frameworks:**
Ultrasonic Sensors: These sensors detect recyclable waste and are calibrated to identify specific materials accurately.
Raspberry Pi Setup: The Raspberry Pi serves as the central microprocessor, handling both backend machine learning 
processing and frontend interface functions.
Camera for Object Detection: A camera system captures images of waste, sending real-time data to the backend machine 
learning model for classification.

**GitHub:**
GitHub was used for version control, allowing team members to manage the project efficiently and collaborate seamlessly.
Technologies Used:

**Backend:** Python, along with libraries such as TensorFlow for machine learning and OpenCV for object recognition, powers 
the backend.

**Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were used to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Cloud Platforms: AWS provided cloud storage and deployment services for scalability and remote access.

**Infrastructure:** Cloud services ensured scalability, while local hardware such as the Raspberry Pi managed the system's 
processing.

**Monitoring:** Tools like Grafana helped monitor system performance, including energy consumption and sensor accuracy.
Collaboration Tools: Slack and Trello facilitated effective communication and task management within the team.

## Challenges Encountered

**Lack of a Sufficient and Diverse Dataset:**
The machine learning model faced accuracy issues due to a limited dataset for training, especially when classifying 
similar 
materials.
- **Solution:** Additional images were sourced from online platforms and local recycling centers to diversify the dataset. 
Data augmentation techniques, such as image rotation and scaling, were employed to artificially expand the dataset.

**Integration of the Machine Learning Model:**
The initial integration of the machine learning model resulted in slow processing speeds and less accurate predictions.
- **Solution:** TensorFlow Lite was used to optimize the model for edge devices, and transfer learning techniques were 
applied to speed up training with a smaller dataset.

**Designing the User Interface:**
Creating an intuitive and engaging user interface without overwhelming users proved challenging.
- **Solution:** Iterative design was implemented, incorporating user feedback to prioritize clarity and simplicity, 
resulting 
in a minimalistic and functional layout.

## Accomplishments

**Eco-Friendly, Cost-Effective Design:** The system was designed to be affordable and environmentally conscious, using low-
energy components and ensuring a minimal carbon footprint during production.

**Modular System Design:** Separating the front-end and back-end components streamlined the manufacturing process, making 
the system scalable with minimal additional hardware.

**Minimal User Input:** The system requires minimal user effort, ensuring accessibility for individuals with limited 
technical knowledge and encouraging more widespread adoption of recycling practices.

**Effective Demonstrations:** Progress was quickly achieved during the first day of the hackathon, with a live prototype 
successfully demonstrated on the second day, showcasing the system’s core functionality.

## Lessons Learned
**Machine Learning and Data:** The importance of large and diverse datasets was emphasized during development. Accurate 
object classification can only be achieved by using a sufficiently varied dataset, which requires substantial time and 
effort to build.
**Infrastructure and Ventilation:** Designing for heat dissipation, even in low-power devices like the Raspberry Pi, 
proved to be crucial. Ensuring proper ventilation prevented performance issues during long-term use.

## What’s Next for Recycle-it

**Adjust Exposure for Image Enhancement:**
The camera settings will be refined to improve image quality by adjusting exposure levels. This will help capture more 
details for better classification and contamination detection.

**Collaboration and Sponsorship:**
Efforts will be made to partner with the City of Edmonton and other municipalities to pilot the system, making recycling 
more accessible at the community level. Additionally, eco-friendly brands will be approached for potential sponsorships.

**Expand Classification Categories:**
The system will be enhanced to identify a wider range of materials, such as electronics and mixed waste, to support more 
comprehensive recycling efforts.

**Upgrade Server Infrastructure for Scalability:**
Server capacity will be increased to support higher user traffic, preventing slowdowns and improving system performance 
under heavy loads.

**Add Interactive Audio Features:**
Interactive audio prompts will be introduced to guide users through the recycling process, encouraging proper sorting and 
providing information on the environmental impact of correct disposal.

**Train the Machine Learning Model with More Data:**
The machine learning model will be continuously trained with additional, less biased datasets to improve classification 
accuracy and reduce errors.

**Ventilation Enhancements:**
Design improvements will be made to incorporate additional ventilation holes, ensuring that the system remains cool during 
prolonged use and prevents any overheating issues.
